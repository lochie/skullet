# Skullet

Smart skeleton states for React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript.

Wrap what you'd render once your data arrives. While it loads, skullet lays that
content out unseen and draws a skeleton over it: a bar for every line of text,
a block for every image, control and button. The skeleton takes exactly the
space the content will, so nothing moves when it arrives.

## Installation

```shell
pnpm i skullet
```

## Usage

### React

Pass your data and render from it. It's loading while `data` is `null`:

```tsx
import { Skeleton } from "skullet/react";

<Skeleton data={user} sample={SAMPLE_USER}>
  {(user) => <Card user={user} />}
</Skeleton>;
```

Or toggle it yourself, with plain children:

```tsx
<Skeleton loading={!user}>
  <Card user={user} />
</Skeleton>
```

| Prop           | Type                     | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data`         | `T \| null \| undefined` | Loading while empty; passed to `children` once it isn't.      |
| `sample`       | `T`                      | Stands in for `data` to draw the very first skeleton.         |
| `loading`      | `boolean`                | Shows the skeleton, even over `data` — say, while refetching. |
| `id`           | `string`                 | Remembers the skeleton's shape across visits under this key.  |
| `label`        | `string`                 | Read to screen readers while loading.                         |
| `skeleton`     | `ReactNode`              | Shown while loading instead of the measured skeleton.         |
| `error`        | `ReactNode`              | Shown instead of the content when set.                        |
| `empty`        | `boolean`                | Shows `emptyMessage`, or the content if there's none.         |
| `emptyMessage` | `ReactNode`              |                                                               |

### Vue

```vue
<template>
  <Skeleton :data="user" :sample="SAMPLE_USER">
    <template #default="{ data }">
      <Card :user="data" />
    </template>
  </Skeleton>
</template>

<script setup>
import { Skeleton } from "skullet/vue";
</script>
```

Slots: `default` (with `{ data }`), `skeleton`, `empty`, `error` (with `{ error }`).

### Svelte

```svelte
<script>
  import { Skeleton } from "skullet/svelte";
</script>

<Skeleton data={user} sample={SAMPLE_USER}>
  {#snippet children(user)}
    <Card {user} />
  {/snippet}
</Skeleton>
```

Snippets: `children(data)`, `skeleton`, `emptyMessage`, `errorMessage(error)`.

### Vanilla

```ts
import { Reveal } from "skullet";

const reveal = new Reveal(document.getElementById("card"), { id: "profile" });

reveal.load(renderCard(SAMPLE_USER));
// once loaded
reveal.show(renderCard(user));
// a later reload: drawn from the card last shown
reveal.load();
```

### Suspense (React)

A Suspense boundary whose fallback is a measured skeleton:

```tsx
import { SkeletonSuspense } from "skullet/react";

<SkeletonSuspense skeleton={<Quote quote={SAMPLE_QUOTE} />}>
  <LoadedQuote /> {/* calls use(promise) */}
</SkeletonSuspense>;
```

## Provider

`SkulletProvider` sets skullet up for everything inside it, per render — so a
nonce can differ per request. React, Vue and Svelte each export one.

```tsx
import { SkulletProvider } from "skullet/react";

<SkulletProvider
  nonce={nonce} // on the inline script and stylesheets, for a Content Security Policy
  mode="system" // or "light" / "dark"
  theme={theme} // below
  text={{ top: "ascender", bottom: "descender" }} // where each line of text is drawn
  reveal="smart" // or "together" / "sequence" / "sweep"
  debug // the overlay, below
>
  <App />
</SkulletProvider>;
```

### Theming

A theme is colours for light and dark, plus how skeletons look and move:

```ts
const theme = {
  light: { base: "rgb(0 0 0 / 0.07)", highlight: "rgb(255 255 255 / 0.6)" },
  dark: {
    base: "rgb(255 255 255 / 0.08)",
    highlight: "rgb(255 255 255 / 0.1)",
  },
  animation: "shimmer", // "group-shimmer", "pulse" or "none"
  speed: "slow", // or "fast" — shimmer 4s / 2s, pulse 2.4s / 1.2s
  radius: "6px", // lines of text and boxes; images and chips keep their own
  text: { top: "ascender", bottom: "descender" },
};
```

- `speed` is set per animation: a shimmer loops in 4s or 2s, a pulse in 2.4s
  or 1.2s. A shimmer keeps the pace it has across a 1280px screen on any
  width, so a wide monitor doesn't make it race.
- `shimmer` sweeps one highlight across the whole page; `group-shimmer` gives
  each skeleton a sweep of its own; `pulse` fades every skeleton softly in and out.
  Each keeps one phase across the page.
- Every option is a custom property underneath — `--skullet-base`,
  `--skullet-highlight`, `--skullet-radius`, `--skullet-animation`, `--skullet-speed`,
  `--skullet-text-top` and `--skullet-text-bottom` — so any part of a page can set
  its own, and plain CSS can set them without a provider. Vanilla JavaScript
  has `applyTheme(theme, mode)`, and `themeVariables(theme, mode)` returns
  them for a style attribute.

The docs have a theme creator to try them in.

### Lines of text

Each line of text gets a bar between two of the type's own lines, measured
from the font: a top of `ascender`, `cap-height` or `x-height`, and a bottom of
`baseline` or `descender`. The default, `ascender` to `descender`, takes in
hanging letters like g, p and y.

```tsx
<SkulletProvider text={{ top: "x-height", bottom: "baseline" }}>
```

Or in CSS, anywhere — they're inherited, so a section can differ:

```css
.compact {
  --skullet-text-top: x-height;
  --skullet-text-bottom: baseline;
}
```

### Reveals

How content replaces its skeleton, set with `reveal` on the provider:

- `together` crossfades skeleton and content whole.
- `sequence` brings each piece in where its skeleton was, top to bottom.
- `sweep` carries the content in behind one diagonal front at the shimmer's
  slant and pace — giving way to a crossfade for a reveal over about a screen
  and a half, or if frames drop mid-way.
- `smart` (the default) decides for each reveal as it lands: at once for
  someone mid-gesture or a load under 150ms (a skeleton is held back that long,
  so a fast load never flashes one); a quick crossfade for a refetch; whole for
  something small; otherwise in sequence — rows and cards as units, in screen
  order, smaller text a beat behind, off-screen content at once.

Or pass a `RevealSpec` of your own: an order, an entrance, a wipe, timing. The
built-ins are written with it, and exported to build on.

### Accessibility

A loading reveal is `aria-busy`; its skeleton is hidden from screen readers
and `inert`, server-rendered too. Pass `label` to have something read in its
place: `label="Loading profile"`. Everything holds still under
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Debugging

Pass `debug` to the provider, or add `?skullet-debug` to the URL: every reveal
is outlined with where its skeleton came from, then whether the content moved
anything when it arrived. Its x-ray shows the content each skeleton was
measured from.

## Where the skeleton's shape comes from

Skullet uses the best it has, in this order:

1. The data on screen, when you force `loading` over it.
2. The data it last showed under the same `id`, so a reload is exact.
3. The shape remembered from a previous visit.
4. Your `sample`.
5. Plain children, rendered without their data.
6. A few generic lines, with a warning in development.

In development, skullet warns when a skeleton and its content differ in size,
and when data-driven content has no `sample` it logs one for you to paste, with
your data's keys and lengths and every value replaced.

Remembered shapes keep layout, never content: text is replaced with filler,
and media sources and form values are dropped. Clear them on sign-out:

```ts
import { forgetShapes } from "skullet";

forgetShapes();
```

## Hints

- `skullet-block` draws an element as one block.
- `skullet-ignore` draws nothing for an element.
- In React, a component with a static `Skeleton` is rendered as that instead:

```tsx
Avatar.Skeleton = () => <SkeletonBox width={40} height={40} radius="50%" />;
```

## Placeholder boxes

```tsx
import { SkeletonBox } from "skullet/react";

<SkeletonBox width="60%" height="1em" radius="0.25em" />;
```

Numbers are read as pixels. In vanilla JavaScript, `createSkeletonBox(options)`
returns the element.

## Server rendering

A server-rendered skeleton is measured before the page first paints: a small
inline script follows each one, so the first paint already shows the skeleton —
no flash of content, and no change when the page hydrates. With JavaScript
off, each line of text is struck through with a bar instead.

On React 19 the stylesheet is rendered into the page for you. With anything
else, import it once:

```ts
import "skullet/styles.css";
```

## Notes

- Every skeleton on the page shimmers in one stream, however late it mounts.
- An image never holds anything else back: each one still loading keeps a skeleton
  of its own until it has loaded and decoded, then the two crossfade.
- Fades and the shimmer respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Give images a size (`width` and `height`, or an `aspect-ratio`); one that only
  gets it on load moves once it does, and the development warning names it.
- Under a `SkulletProvider`, the server-render script is sent once a page; without
  one, every skeleton carries its own copy.
